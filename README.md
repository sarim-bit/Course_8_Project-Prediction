# Course_8_Project-Prediction
This is the project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning class. 

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

The training data for this project are available here:
